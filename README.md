# PasswordGenerator
A simple password generator program that allows a user to select a password length and specified character types and outputs a password string.

In a time where we need accounts and passwords for basically everything, it can be a pain to create new and unique passwords. I created this password generator to alleviate this small pain.
I plan to add features that allow the user to specify specific characters to exclude and a faisafe to ensure each type of character is used etc.
